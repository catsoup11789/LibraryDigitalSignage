# Kirby

Kirby is a file-based CMS.
Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell.

## The Panel

You can find the login for Kirby's admin interface at
http://yourdomain.com/panel. You will be guided through the signup
process for your first user, when you visit the panel
for the first time.

## Installation

Kirby does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install. Just copy Kirby's files to your server and visit the
URL for your website in the browser.

**Please check if the invisible .htaccess file has been
copied to your server correctly**

### Requirements

Kirby runs on PHP 7.1+, Apache or Nginx.

### Download Kirby with Git

If you are familiar with Git, you can clone Kirby's
Starterkit repository from Github.

    git clone https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit.git
